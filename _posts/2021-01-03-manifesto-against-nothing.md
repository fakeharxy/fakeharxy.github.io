I've been thinking a lot recently (new year and all) about trying to never do **Nothing**. Ever.

By **Nothing** in this context I mean unplanned, unconstructive procrastination. It's wanting to do something but instead doing **Nothing**. **Nothing** is addictive and all-consuming. It's the emptiness that saps strength, the boredom that multiplies and self-perpetuates; it's the self-administered poison of the soul.

**Nothing** can be anywhere, but it has a few strongholds where it is particularly potent. **Nothing** in its essence is the absence of doing something you want to do. If you've ever written up a to do list, only to complete none of the items because you endlessly watched Youtube, I'm afraid you were caught in peak **Nothing**.

OK before this all gets a bit didactic, I need to stress something. Anything you actively want to do is not **Nothing**. This is 100% not about judging how people live their lives. You can quickly and easily find where **Nothing** resides in your life. You take a piece of paper, preferably in the morning, and you write what I like to call a "_To Do_" list. Actually, let's call it a _Want To Do_ list. Yeah, that sounds better. Only one rule - and you might have already guessed it: you only write things down that you _want to do_.

Sometimes you might say something like: Oh, I _have_ to wash the car. But you don't have to. The list of things you _have_ to do is vanishingly small: kids, pets, appointments. You _want_ to wash the car, for some reason. Maybe you love driving a clean car? Point is, the things you want to do are something. Everything else is most likely **Nothing**.

Include fun things. Include anything that maybe you've wanted to do for a while. In the unusual case where there is something you **have** to do, write that down too, maybe put a star next to it. 

You should now acknowledge that everything else is something you _want_ to do. Why do you _want_ to do it?

Do the things you want to do. You just wrote down that you want to do them. So do them. If there are things you **have** to do, do them first. They are getting in the way of the things you want to do.

If you wrote down "play videogames" or "watch Netflix for 6 hours", fine. Again, no one, least of all me, should or can tell you how to live your life. I'm talking to the people who didn't write that down, but end up doing it anyway. _The gap between wanting and doing is where **Nothing** lies_.

Ok, let's step back for a second.

We've talked about what **Nothing** is, but not what **Nothing** isn't. It is most certainly not choosing a film you've wanted to see in ages, making a hot cup of tea or some popcorn, getting comfortable maybe with a blanket if it's chilly, and pressing play. That is something. A great big **Something**.

Autoplaying episodes of a sitcom that doesn't make you laugh is **Nothing**.

Treats are not **Nothing**. The more effort that goes into a treat (usually), the more a **Something** it is. Putting purposeful effort into your treats ensures they do not become **Nothing**.

Playing an hour of a videogame that excites you, that is fun and engaging, is so far from **Nothing** as to almost not be worth mentioning. That slightly sick feeling, with the buzzy headache, when you complete a fetch quest and you get 10 more gold and you're so bored, so so bored, is **Nothing**. 

Choosing to watch Youtube videos about a thing that interests you - chess, poker, programming, politics - is not **Nothing**... but boy, do you need to be careful. You're walking a tightrope, kiddo. YouTube would like nothing more than to have you trapped all day watching **Nothing**. 

Let's talk about being vigilant against **Nothing**.

There are many activities that can be **Nothing** and can be **Something**, and noticing which is which can be tricky business. It rule is simple: if you are happy, truly happy with what you're doing, then you're not doing **Nothing**. I know people who get a tremendous amount of joy from playing a lot of computer games. This Manifesto isn't here to tell you how to enjoy life. It's not here to do anything other than maybe get you to notice if you are, in fact, not enjoying what you are doing.

**Nothing** is seductive. **Nothing** can often feel like something. That feeling you get when you have to do a big task, but don't want to? What does your brain do? Let's examine it.

You: _I want to do task A_

Brain: _feels pretty difficult_

You: _Yeah, it does. Maybe instead I'll put on that film I've been meaning to watch / contiue that drawing I started / tidy the kitchen._

Brain: _WAIT! Didn't you just say you need to do Task A? We discussed this. You should do Task A._

You: _Ok, I'll do task A. Let me just look at my phone first._

Brain: _Your phone? Sure. That's Nothing. You aren't delaying Task A, because looking at your phone only takes a minute and is Nothing. It's not like watching a film or drawing a tiger or tidying the kitchen._

Two hours later you are in the void of Nothing. Task A is not done, but worse, the film is unwatched, the tiger is undrawn and the kitchen is untidied. As a quick aside, phones - and particularly infinite scroll - are the harbingers, the patron saints of **Nothing**.

So here is my personal Manifesto against Nothing. Yours might be different:
1. I will be aware of what I am doing. I will write down everything I want to do, even fun things. If I want to do it, I should.


2. I will avoid any product that incorporates infinite scrolling. Infinite scrolling is the Nothing generator, the heart of browsing without purpose, the maggot in the apple of the internet. For me, this means Facebook, Instagram, and especially Reddit is gone. 


3. When something is hard, I will recognise and acknowledge the call of Nothing. Every time I open a new tab, or pick up my phone, I shall question if I am avoiding something else I want to do. I will call Nothing what it is, and fill my life with Something.


4. When my brain is pleading with me to do anything else, if I cannot win the battle of procrastination, I will give it anything better than Nothing. A book, a videogame, a piece of paper to doodle on. After a few minutes, I'll consult my list of things I **want** to do.
