I've been thinking a lot recently (new year and all) about seeing if there is anything I can do to limit the amount of **Nothing** I've been doing. Maybe limiting it to zero.

By **Nothing** in this context I mean unplanned, unconstructive procrastination. Wanting to do something but instead doing **Nothing**.

Doing **Nothing** is addictive and all-consuming. It's the emptiness that saps strength, the boredom that multiplies and self-perpetuates, the self-administered poison of the soul.

**Nothing** in its essence is the absence of doing something you want to do. If you've ever woken up with the world at your feet, ready to pounce, only to endlessly watch Youtube, I'm afraid you were caught in peak **Nothing**.

But before this all gets a bit didactic, let me stress something. Anything you actively want to do is not **Nothing**. This is not about judging how people live their lives. 

**Nothing** can arise anywhere, but it has a few strongholds where it is particularly potent. You can quickly and easily find where **Nothing** resides in your life. You take a piece of paper, preferably in the morning, and you write what I like to call a _To Do_ list. Actually, let's call it a _Want To Do_ list. Yeah, that's closer to its true nature. Only one rule - and you might have already guessed it: you only write things down that you _want to do_.

Sometimes you might say something like: Oh, I _have_ to wash the car. But you don't have to. The list of things you _have_ to do is vanishingly small: kids, pets, jury duty. You _want_ to wash the car, for some reason. Maybe you love driving a clean car? Point is, the things you _want_ to do are something. Everything else is most likely **Nothing**.

If it's not clear: include fun things on this list. Include anything that maybe you've wanted to do for a while. In the unusual case where there is something you **have** to do, write that down too, maybe put a star next to it.

Ok, take a second, maybe a deep breath. Acknowledge that everything else on this list is something you _want_ to do. Why do you _want_ to do them?

That's the thinking done. Do the things you want to do. You just wrote down that you _want_ to do them. No one forced you to. So do them.

If you wrote down "play videogames" or "watch Netflix for 6 hours", fine. Again, no one, least of all me, should have any say in what you want to do with your life. Who I'm talking to is the people who don't write that down, but end up doing it anyway. _The gap between wanting and doing is where **Nothing** lives_.

I've described what **Nothing** is, but it's a tricky beast. **Nothing** is wily.

It is most certainly not choosing a film you've wanted to see in ages, making a hot cup of tea or some popcorn, getting comfortable maybe with a blanket if it's chilly, and pressing play. That is something. A great big **Something**.

But it is autoplaying episodes of a sitcom that doesn't make you laugh or feel anything.

Treats are not **Nothing**. The more effort that goes into a treat (usually), the more a **Something** it is. Putting purposeful effort into your treats ensures they do not become **Nothing**. Putting purposeful effort into anything ensures it does not become **Nothing**.

Playing an hour of a videogame that excites you, that is fun and engaging, is far from **Nothing**. 

That slightly sick feeling, with the buzzy headache, when you complete a fetch quest and you get 10 more gold and you're so bored, so so bored, is **Nothing**.

Choosing to watch Youtube videos about a thing that interests you - chess, poker, programming, politics - is not **Nothing**... but boy, do you need to be careful. You're walking a tightrope, kiddo. YouTube would like nothing more than to have you trapped all day watching **Nothing**, and has spent millions figuring out how.

Be vigilant against **Nothing**.

The rule is simple: if you are happy, truly happy with what you're doing, then you're not doing **Nothing**. You can get your joy from anywhere. I repeat: the Manifesto isn't to tell you how to enjoy life. It's not here to do anything other than maybe get you to notice if you are, in fact, not enjoying it.

Final thing: **Nothing** is seductive. **Nothing** can often feel like something. Your brain likes it, because your brain is a lazy douchebag. There are times when your brain would rather do **Nothing** than anything else, even something you enjoy.

It looks a little like this:

**You**: _I should do task A_

**Brain**: _feels pretty difficult_

**You**: _Yeah, it does. Maybe instead I'll put on that film I've been meaning to watch / contiue that drawing I started / tidy the kitchen._

**Brain**: _WAIT! Didn't you just say you need to do Task A? We discussed this. You shouldn't be distracted from Task A by that other stuff._

**You**: _Ok. I'll just look at my phone then._

**Brain**: _Your phone? Sure. You aren't delaying Task A, because your phone is Nothing. It's not like watching a film or drawing a tiger or tidying the kitchen._

Two hours later you are in the void of **Nothing**. Task A is not done, but worse, the film is unwatched, the tiger is undrawn and the kitchen is untidied. As a quick aside, phones are the harbingers, the patron saints of **Nothing**. They are a box of **Nothing** that society all but mandates you carry with you at all times.

So here is my personal Manifesto against Nothing. You may not agree with any or all of it. It is very much suited to me.

  1. I will be aware of what I am doing. I will write down everything I want to do, even fun things. If I want to do it, there should be no reason I do not do it.
  1. I will avoid any product that incorporates infinite scrolling. Infinite scrolling is the **Nothing** whirlpool, the heart of browsing without purpose, the maggot in the apple of the internet. For me, this means Facebook, Instagram, and especially Reddit is gone.
  1. When a task is hard, I will recognise and acknowledge the call of **Nothing**. Every time I open a new tab, or pick up my phone, I shall question if I am avoiding something, something I want to do. I will call **Nothing** what it is, and aim to fill my life with **Something**.
  1. When my brain is pleading with me to do anything else, if I cannot win the battle against procrastination, I will give it anything better than **Nothing**. A book, a videogame, a piece of paper to doodle on. After a few minutes, I'll consult my list of things I **want** to do.

And that's it. This is just for me, and is very specific to me, but if it helps anyone, I'm very glad.
