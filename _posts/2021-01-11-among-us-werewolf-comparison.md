I probably don't need to tell you InnerSloth's online multi-player detect-'em-up **Among Us**'s short but fascinating history: roundly ignored for two years, then pushed into intense and sustained popularity, fuelled by streamers, [easily meme-able characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/) and a simple pick-up-and-play aesthetic hiding clever mechanisms and deep gameplay.

If you haven't played it, it's an excellent little game and one that I have a strong feeling will only get better over the coming months and years as InnerSloth fix n' tweak the options to be more accommodating across a variety of setups. Currently the game only really hums at a few fragile bandwidths: five/six player with one imposter or ten players with two. I'm baffled there is even an option for three imposters but perhaps that is just future-proofing.

Now the board game community will tell you Among Us is nothing new. In fact the first time I heard the words Among Us, they were nestled in a sentence alongside "Werewolf clone" or, to use the genre parlance: "Social Deduction". This is not a pejorative, just a handy bucket in which to put games and experiences. Before I talk about that, I think Werewolf is just rare enough outside of board gaming circles that it's worth explaining what being in this bucket means and what else it contains.

Werewolf is a popular party game. So popular, in fact, that it even had a brief moment of fame in Silicon Valley tech circles, if [Wired is to be believed](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf). It also spawned an entire genre of modern board gaming, typified by the traitor mechanic that runs through probably hundreds of games at this point: off the top of my head, I can name The Resistance, Saboteur, Don't Mess with Cthulhu, Battlestar Galactica, Room 25, Shadows Over Camelot, Secret Hitler... and that is without even turning my head to look at my game shelf.

The premise is grim, if you think about it for even a second: a werewolf or werewolves prowl a conceptual village (a group of players, around 7 to 15 works best). All the players who aren't werewolves are known as villagers; the werewolves are selected randomly and part of their remit is to appear as villager-like as possible throughout.

The game revolves through two phases. In the night phase, the werewolves kill a villager (the game requires a moderator to facilitate all the murder). During the day phase, a discussion happens, a discussion of course in which the werewolves are active contributors, and at the end of the day, a person must be hung (I told you: grim). At least 70% of the time, you accidentally hang a honest, innocent villager. This is because (the pop psychology crowd like to say) people with information are excellently positioned to manipulate people who have no information. An "informed minority against and uninformed majority".

There are more rules - special abilities for the villagers to level the playing field and other quirks - but this is the crux. It's a fascinating group dynamic to watch, and as I've been the moderator more times than an actual player, I've had the joy of seeing brilliant emergent behaviour grow out of this simple ruleset. My favourite was a particularly sneaky werewolf, who befriended her next door neighbour and maintained a good, trusting relationship, even encouraging her naive partner to accuse and vote in certain directions, thus keeping suspicion and retribution away from herself. It's micro-events like this one within the wider game that make it so good - like the best games, Werewolf is a story generator.

Ostensibly, Among Us shares a lot of its DNA with these and others like it - but it has what should be the great advantage of being a computer game, and thus a vastly superior set of tools with which to bleed information into the system.

Among Us has the hidden traitor mechanic too - in this case, called imposters. The crew (villagers) are attempting to complete tasks, simultaneously keeping an eye out for who is in fact only pretending to complete tasks and instead has murderous intentions. The difference to me boils down to one thing and it's why Innersloth has made something different to these cardboard games: not better, not worse, but different. And that thing is: reasonable doubt. 

In almost all (in fact, I'm going to push my chips in: all) the tabletop games I've listed above, nothing is ever certain. You can suspect people strongly - and, admittedly, it is possible for someone to screw up so bad that their intentions become truly obvious - but it's rare. Most of the time, you've only hunches backed up by circumstantial evidence. "This person seems to be acting without our best interests at heart." "But I've had really bad cards! I'm sorry I haven't been able to help." "Hmm... fine. But [in the parlance of the day] - they are sus." 

That certainly sounds like Among Us. But there is a difference. Among Us has cold, hard facts. If you see someone kill, or someone vent (venting being a special ability that only imposters can perform), you know 100% that that person is not on the side of good. In essence, InnerSloth didn't include the 'deduction' in Social Deduction. Among Us is not a deductive game.

Now, you may argue, the witness still needs to convince a room full of people of the imposter's guilt. Actually, that's not true. If there are 5+ people left in the game, it's over. The conversation will go a little something like this:

**Witness**: "I saw Red vent."

**Imposter**: "What! I did not vent. This is clearly a move by the imposter. White is the true enemy."

**Witness**: "Ok, eject me. Then, when I'm good, eject Red."

Check and mate. This particular tactic works because the crew win or lose together - if you die, or are ejected from the spaceship, it doesn't matter. As long as the crew win, you win.

The system has no need for suspicion, and there is no room really for speculation. It is not a game of Werewolf in this scenario, even if it feels like it. It's something else. So what is it?

Among Us's failing as a game of Werewolf does not make the game a failure. It's in fact a real-time detective cat and mouse. The imposter has to act carefully, stealthily, and slowly (whilst still killing quickly enough to prevent the tasks from being completed) and the crew have to be on their toes. Every crew member has a responsibility to inhabit the role they've been given - of detective - and to be aware of what their fellow 'mates are doing. There are still massively satisfying gotchas and - something I highlighted as a strength of Werewolf earlier - it is still a fantastic story generator.

It is absolutely critical for the imposter to not be seen (or, in absolutely thrilling moments of drama, be seen but chase and disable the witness). This often leads to short games, but as it's as quick as pressing a button to rack up and play again, this isn't really a disadvantage.

There are still problems - the main of which I mentioned at the top of this article, one that plagues almost every game in existence, online or otherwise: balance. Two imposters seem wildly strong in all but a ten player game, but one imposter feels vulnerable and lonely at more than six or seven.

The bigger issue for me is that the game is multitudes more entertaining as the imposter, because the investigative nature of the crew mates is only a decimal of what you'll actually be doing: tasks, as mundane as your desk job. And in a game of eight people with one imposter, prepare to be the imposter once or twice an evening.

So is Among Us a werewolf clone? Actually, no, and honestly they might only be tangentially related. Is it good? Yes, it's a flawed diamond, which is hopefully already in the process of being polished. But I think there is still room for the perfect online Social Deduction game - we're close, we're iterating towards it, and I'm excited about playing it.
